## My process

I first started with looking at the original image and drawing on my notebook a large rectangle to indicate the browser.
Prior to drawing the QR-component I highlighted areas that can be wrapped in a div. Such as the image and the text with the text also being wrapped in another div. Once I've layed out which components are in div's I started off writing the structure with HTML first. I did add the background color as-well and some borders to make sure that I had the structure down. I added some semantic html such as main then section.

The section would center the content and add margin from the top.
Inside the section are two divs, one to contain the image and paragraphs and a nest div to wrap the paragraphs. Most of the elements have class included for styling purposes.

Now that the structure is complete I moved over to the styling. The majority of my time was spent on

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

Understanding flex box and flex direction influence with justify content and align items. I learned how to make images circular by setting the width and height at the same px and setting the border radius to 50%.
The size of the width of an element can affect the values of justify content if there isn't enough space.

### Continued development

I'm interested to figure out what ways I can use :hover for the homepage. After that I'll probably stop development for this webpage.
